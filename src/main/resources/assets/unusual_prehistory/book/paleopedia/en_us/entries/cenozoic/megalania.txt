The Megalania is an ancient species of gigantic monitor lizard which was once a terrifying apex predator during the Pleistocene no doubt helped by their fast acting venom. It has been observed that depending on the conditions of the Megalania’s environment it’s appearance, temperament and behaviour will change in relation to these changes.

When in temperate climates these large lizards possess a bright blue to green tail. Furthermore they will for the most part display more docile and calm behaviour such as even tolerating the presence of humans. However, despite this these predatory lizards still display predatory behaviour and will lash out if not left alone by humans.

When in colder climates, their tails will dawn a pale blue colour. Along with this they will become far more sluggish and slow than usual, often sleeping most of the day to conserve their energy. Due to them being in this torpor like state they lose almost all predatory instinct and are largely apathetic to the presence of humans unless provoked.

When in hotter climates, the colour of their tails will change to a dramatic red and orange blend. Moreover, in this state they will become more agile and faster, along with this they will display heightened predatory instinct and will attack humans unprovoked.

And finally when within the Nether the Megalania displays the most drastic change out of all other conditions. First off the Megalania will adopt a light brown texture on their scales and a very vibrant bright purple tail. Along with this fiery coloration, their behaviour will become similarly hot-headed, in this state Megalania's have been observed to become even faster than their hot climate state and display hyper aggressive behaviour, attacking anything and everything in sight including members of their own species. It is advised to keep any specimens in this state away from other animals or people.
